# simple-vue-js-punching-game

This week I’ve been checking out Vue.js and so far I’m loving it! I have done a little bit of React so far, so its not super foreign to me. 

This game is purely made from vue.js. 

#A Minimal Vue.js Setup

Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.
